                <p style="margin-left: 30px"> I have lived in florida my whole life. I dont fight 
                    aligators or go fishing, not that theres anything wrong 
                    with that to each their own. I just soak up the sun all 
                    year round, sweat my heart 
                    out in the summer, and freeze to death anytime the 
                    weather drops below 60 degrees. Im really excited to 
                    learn more about coding in general and python especially
                    since I've already scrated the surface while preparing 
                    for my bootcamp.

                    I love eatting, I mean who doesnt, but Its caused me to 
                    fall in love with cooking. Ive been cooking for friends 
                    and family for the past couple of years its fun and really 
                    really rewarding when people enjoy your food. I also love 
                    working out and playing basketball and you have to be eatting 
                    right when your exercising a good amount every week. That 
                    coupled with trying to save money in college and also enjoying 
                    food really sparked my intrest in cooking.

                <h1>What's Next For Me</h1>
                <strong><small>My current goal is to complete coding bootcamp</small></strong>
                <p>At the moment my biggest goal is to learn and absorb as much as I possbily
                    can. Im very excited for the start of my course and more obvously the completion.
                    I hope to get working in the field as soon as I can and continue to build on top 
                    of what I will learn in the next 10 weeks.
